# 🚗 Car Condition Classification & Prediction System

An end-to-end AI-based system for **car condition analysis and grading**, combining **deep learning, machine learning, backend APIs, and frontend visualization**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on:
- Detecting **visual car damage** (scratches, dents, normal condition)
- Predicting **overall car condition grades** (A+, A, B, C)
- Deploying the solution using a modern **full-stack architecture**

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

### 🔹 Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- **ResNet-50 (CNN)** for image-based car condition classification  
- **XGBoost** for structured data-based car condition grading  
- **Accuracy Achieved:**
  - Image Classification (ResNet-50): **87%**
  - Condition Grade Prediction (XGBoost): **80%**

### 🔹 Datasets
- **Kaggle Dataset**: Car condition images (scratches, dents, normal, etc.)
- **PakWheels Data**: Scraped *only for educational and testing purposes*

---

## 🗄️ Database
- **MongoDB**
  - Stores scraped car data
  - Stores predicted car conditions and grades

---

## ⚙️ Backend
- **FastAPI (Python)**
- RESTful APIs for:
  - Image inference
  - Condition prediction
  - Database interaction

---

## 🎨 Frontend
- **React.js**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- Displays:
  - Car listings
  - Predicted conditions
  - Clean and responsive UI

---

## 🔧 Features
- Image-based damage detection
- Condition grading (A+ / A / B / C)
- Real-world testing on scraped data
- Scalable backend architecture
- ML-ready structured database

---

## 📁 Project Workflow

1. Train ResNet-50 on Kaggle image dataset  
2. Test model on real scraped car images  
3. Store results in MongoDB  
4. Train XGBoost model for condition grading  
5. Serve predictions using FastAPI  
6. Visualize results using React frontend
